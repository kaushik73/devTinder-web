The socket instance (created by socket.io-client) is non-serializable.

Redux expects state to be serializable for proper debugging and predictable state updates.

Why Use Both Context and Redux:

The SocketContextProvider handles the socket instance, which is non-serializable and thus unsuitable for Redux.

Redux only stores the serializable data, such as the onlineUsers, making state management more predictable and error-free.

This separation keeps the socket instance isolated from Redux while still giving components access to both the instance (through context) and onlineUsers (through Redux).
